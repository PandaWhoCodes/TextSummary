      "A truce between US and Chinese leaders on trade tariffs provided a boost to global markets on Monday, fuelling a nearly one per cent surge on world stocks and pushing emerging currencies higher across the dollar.\n",

      "European share benchmarks opened sharply higher, with Germany's DAX - the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - leading the way with a 2.5 per cent rise to its highest level since November 14, and Wall Street too was set for a stronger session.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gains came after China and the United States agreed at the weekend to halt additional tariffs on each other. The deal prevents their trade war escalating as the two sides try to bridge differences with fresh talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "US President Donald Trump also said “China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US. Currently the tariff is 40 per cent”. That helped boost European autos more than 4 per cent.\n",

      "“We are going to see a rally in emerging market and U.S equities, EM currencies and China-related assets like Australia. I expect the rally to last until year-end.”\n",

Emerging equities rose 2.1 per cent and were set for their strongest day in a month. Asian shares kicked off the gains, with Chinese mainland markets rising more than 2.5 per cent while Japan's Nikkei gained as much as 1.3 per cent to a six-week high.\n",

      "The risk-on mood drove the US dollar 0.4 per cent lower against a basket of currencies while against the euro it slumped 0.6 per cent. The greenback has already come under some pressure from the recent subtle shift in the US Federal Reserve's policy communication to a slightly more dovish stance.\n",

      "Comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate hikes. Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee but his hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former US President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florian Hense, economist at Berenberg, said the market rally would not bring a return to a more hawkish Fed stance. “We would need to see some rebound in economic activity to lift expectations of more rate hikes,” he said.\n",

      "Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro area, was set for its biggest one-day yield jump in a month, rising four basis points to a high of 0.347 per ent. Yields on riskier southern European bonds fell across the board, with Italian yields down around 10 bps to new two-month lows.,.\n",

      "“Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment,” said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai.\n",
