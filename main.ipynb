      "\n",
      "Sovereign bonds and stocks rallied in India on optimism of a more dovish monetary policy after the government named former bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das as the central bank chief.\n",
      "“Although one cannot say with certainty, it is likely that Das may have a neutral-to-dovish bent on monetary policy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy rates in India are decided by a monetary policy panel, which includes the governor.\n",
      "The government wants more control over the RBI’s functions and higher dividends to help finance its deficit, a flashpoint between the authorities and Patel that led to his departure.\n",
      "“Overseas investors are worried about central bank’s independence, specially after the manner of Patel’s exit,” says Paresh Nayar, Mumbai-based head of currency and money markets at FirstRand Ltd. “State poll losses and Patel’s exit has led foreign investors to sell substantially over the last two sessions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some investors fear that Tuesday’s setback at the state elections may force the government to be more strident in its demand for the RBI to loosen curbs on some of the weakest banks to ensure lending continues ahead of an election next year.\n",
      "“Given his history as former bureaucrat, it does nothing to ally concerns regarding government interference in RBI policy,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.\n",

      "Reflecting India’s strength of indigenous capability to design, construct and operate nuclear powers plants and indicates ability to master high-end technology, at 9.20 pm on Dec 10, 2018, a world record was set when Unit-1 of Kaiga Generating Station (KGS) continuously operated nuclear power reactors by clocking 941 days of non-stop run.\n",
      "This is the second time KGS-1 has set a world record and stands second in the world among the Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and in terms of operating continuously, it stands at the fourth position among all nuclear power reactors.\n",
      "This feat assumes significance in light of India’s domestic nuclear power programme, getting a push by the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is also the Minister in-charge of Atomic Energy, giving approval for construction of 10 units each of 700 MW of PHWR in fleet mode.\n",
      "Reportedly, the 220 mw KGS-1 is an indigenous PHWR fuelled by domestic fuel, and started its commercial operation in Nov 2000, generating about 2576 crore units of electricity.\n",
      "Presently, there are 21 reactors under different stage of construction, including 4 Units at Kudankulam with Russian collaboration and 1 fast breeder reactor augmenting the total installed capacity to 22,480 MW by 2031-32.\n",
